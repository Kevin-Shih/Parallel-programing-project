# 2024-Fall NYCU Parallel Programing Final Project

## Parallelization of RRT Algorithm
- Visualiztion ~~and opencv(readmap)~~ not yet ready.
- ~~Find or design a map image.~~
- ~~Maybe need a main.cpp as a wrapper,~~ easier to compare **sequential**, **OMP**, **CUDA** version.  
    -> Directly use RRT.cpp as main. include and run all version in RRT.cpp main func.
- Make file: compile ~~main and sequential~~, **OMP**, **CUDA** version RRT & Util program.

## 工作分配
**CPP**
- Need 1 Freddy Chen
- Need 2 Joker
- Need 3 施泰俊
